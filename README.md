This repository contains the data produced in the study of eccentric planet disc interactions. The production of this data is detailed fully the paper.

- circular/ 
  - parameters.out: stores the eccentricity values e and disc parameters for q, p and h
  - t_net_m1.out: net torque including the m = 1 mode
  - t_net_m2.out: net torque excluding the m = 1 mode
