This repository contains the data produced in the study of eccentric planet disc interactions. The production of this data is detailed fully the paper.

The data is divided into the circular and the eccentric result directories. Each of the files contains the results across a variety of eccentricity and disc parameters.

- $p$

- circular/ 
  - parameters.out: stores the eccentricity values e and disc parameters for q, p and h
  - t_net_m1.out: net torque including the m = 1 mode
  - t_net_m2.out: net torque excluding the m = 1 mode
  - t_l_m1.out: Lindblad torque including the m = 1 mode
  - t_l_m2.out: Lindblad torque excluding the m = 1 mode
  - t_c_m1.out: Corotation torque including the m = 1 mode
  - t_c_m2.out: Corotation torque including the m = 1 mode
